# Food Adventure ver.0.1

This is an application that will decide where you should eat for situations when you and your group of friends can't decide on a restaurant!

## Description

This appplication has two main functions. After the user inputs a zip code, the user may choose to completely randomize restaurant suggestions or decide to set preferences on various parameters. The user may then click on the link of a given restaurant and get navigation information using the Google Maps API.

## Future Developement

While we were unable to submit this for our first version, we want to add the following features in future versions of this application:
- Adding more style and aesthetics to the website. This is a very simplified version using basic colors.
- Adding more questions for user preferences to account for allergies, dietary restrictions, and more.
- Creating a feature where the user can order delivery from the restaurant on GrubHub if available.
- Creating a feature where the user can choose a dish and get back a recipe on how to make it if they're in a cooking mood.
